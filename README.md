## Project: EasyPath

We provide Canadian high school students and their parents with an all-in-one platform to organize and plan post-secondary paths. We help students and parents search and compare programs, stay on top of deadlines and program requirements, and discover scholarship opportunities. Our mission is simple: we want to help reduce the stress of applying for post-secondary.

Our app is designed to be your go-to planning assistant for navigating the difficulties of post-secondary applications. We are here to simplify the planning process and make you feel confident with your plan.

## Team:
We are a team of diverse UVic students passionate about making a positive impact on young Canadians. Whether you're interested in social sciences, engineering, or business, we want to reduce the stress of the planning process, as we were all there once!
