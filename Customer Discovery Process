Summary of interviews with a principal, parent, and guidance counsellor:

Parent
Challenges: Finding comprehensive and accessible information to determine the best fit for her son, including program options, school selection, housing, cost, scholarships, and entrance requirements. Official university websites and other resources are helpful but can be incomplete or difficult to navigate.
Current Resources: Primarily uses official university sites, provincial application portals, guidance counselor info, and various comparison sites.
Desired Improvements: Would prefer all information centralized in one app with comparison charts for programs, schools, tuition, scholarships, and admission requirements.
Willingness to Pay: Open to paying for a useful app but wants transparency on the universities and information included. Suggested pricing options for short-term or multi-month access.

High School Principal
Student Struggles: Many students struggle to identify career paths and manage the high cost of living, influencing their choices. Few of her students pursue university directly; many consider trades or colleges instead. Scholarships are particularly complex in BC, with no centralized scholarship information.
Current Resources: Uses myBlueprint and official websites.
Parent and Student Involvement: Parental involvement varies; higher for upper-middle-class families but often lacking for at-risk students.
Common Application Issues: Students often find applications overwhelming and require significant adult support for formal tasks like resumes and scholarship applications.
Preferred Features: A unified platform for scholarships and applications, ideally Western Canadian-specific. Sessions are also held for scholarship writing and application guidance.

Guidance Counselor
Recommended Sites: Suggested resources include GrantMe, ScholarshipCanada, StudentScholarship, and ScholarTree.
Feature Preferences: Key features include autofill, keyword search optimization, comparison tables, and high school grade requirements. An intuitive design with minimal friction is essential to retain student engagement.
Additional Suggestions: Cautions on including accurate acceptance rates, well-managed scholarship info, and AI chat support.

Counselor C: Students often lack practical knowledge of career paths tied to programs and also have difficulty with choosing the right programs for them, and overly high expectations can hinder planning from parents.

2. Strategies for Keeping Students Organized with Applications and Scholarships
Counselor A: We host scholarship workshops, though attendance is low. Procrastination and eligibility confusion are common; an Excel file of scholarships helps but isn't ideal.
Counselor B: Monthly newsletters highlight deadlines, but students may overlook them. Managing timelines amid school work is challenging. Excel file of scholarships.
Counselor C: Students use a checklist but struggle with time management. Many find it difficult to identify scholarships best suited to them even with a website available from school.

3. Value of a Platform Tracking Academic Progress, Interests, and Activities
Counselor A: A centralized platform would help students align their activities with school paths, incorporating both hard and soft skills.
Counselor B: Such a tool would support self-management with reminders and prompts based on personal interests.
Counselor C: Visual career pathways could reduce initial counseling time and resonate more with students.

4. Challenges with Deadlines and Application Management
Counselor A: Students often miss deadlines due to time management issues. An app with reminders and an integrated school calendar would help.
Counselor B: Organization issues, especially at final submission, are common. A resource combining deadline tracking and document guidance could help.
Counselor C: Students tend to procrastinate, so simplified checklists and early alerts would be useful.

5. Benefits of a Centralized Platform for Post-Secondary Planning; incorporating counselors and parents 
Counselor A: Streamlines communication, reduces emails, and provides a unified place for updates, helping all stay informed.
Counselor B: Reduces follow-ups, holds students accountable, and offers resources like sample applications.
